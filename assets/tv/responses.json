different story lines. In flashbacks we see Jo meet her birth mother, the woman who abandoned her at a fire station as a baby. Jo learns she was the product of the rape of her teenage mother.\n\nThen, back at Grey Sloan Memorial, Jo meets a patient named Abby, who she believes has been abused in a domestic situation. Jo, herself a victim of domestic abuse, handles the situation with care—and soon she learns Abby has also been sexually assaulted.\n\nJo brings in another female doctor, Teddy Altman, to help with the situation. They make sure Abby knows she is in a safe space where she can talk if she wants to. Eventually Abby reveals she was raped after leaving a bar—but she's afraid to tell her husband as well as the police, because she knows all too well that her actions may be twisted into a victim-blaming scenario. \n\nOnce they begin collecting evidence for a rape kit (after Abby gives her OK), the process is shown in heartbreaking detail. The doctors ask their patient at each step whether she's ready to proceed. They do nothing until they hear her verbally say, \"Yes.\" And once they do have her permission, they are methodical yet still sensitive as they swab the bite marks on her skin and take samples from inside her body. It's even more gut-wrenching when you consider that it's possible some women may not receive the same kind of care. “What you did today, with Abby, that was not protocol…it should be,\" Teddy later tells Jo.\n\nBut when it's time to take Abby to surgery, she tells the doctors that every man she sees reminds her of her rapist. So the women of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital line the hallway with female faces—doctors, nurses, orderlies, administrative staff—and physically block male staff from entering the space. All so Abby can feel safe.","count":0},{"name":"teddy","desc":"**Teddy Altman** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"maggie","desc":"**Maggie Pierce** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"owen","desc":"**Owen Hunt** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"nicole","desc":"**Nicole Herman** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0}]
