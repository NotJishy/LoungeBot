different story lines. In flashbacks we see Jo meet her birth mother, the woman who abandoned her at a fire station as a baby. Jo learns she was the product of the rape of her teenage mother.\n\nThen, back at Grey Sloan Memorial, Jo meets a patient named Abby, who she believes has been abused in a domestic situation. Jo, herself a victim of domestic abuse, handles the situation with care—and soon she learns Abby has also been sexually assaulted.\n\nJo brings in another female doctor, Teddy Altman, to help with the situation. They make sure Abby knows she is in a safe space where she can talk if she wants to. Eventually Abby reveals she was raped after leaving a bar—but she's afraid to tell her husband as well as the police, because she knows all too well that her actions may be twisted into a victim-blaming scenario. \n\nOnce they begin collecting evidence for a rape kit (after Abby gives her OK), the process is shown in heartbreaking detail. The doctors ask their patient at each step whether she's ready to proceed. They do nothing until they hear her verbally say, \"Yes.\" And once they do have her permission, they are methodical yet still sensitive as they swab the bite marks on her skin and take samples from inside her body. It's even more gut-wrenching when you consider that it's possible some women may not receive the same kind of care. “What you did today, with Abby, that was not protocol…it should be,\" Teddy later tells Jo.\n\nBut when it's time to take Abby to surgery, she tells the doctors that every man she sees reminds her of her rapist. So the women of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital line the hallway with female faces—doctors, nurses, orderlies, administrative staff—and physically block male staff from entering the space. All so Abby can feel safe.","count":0},{"name":"teddy","desc":"**Teddy Altman** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"maggie","desc":"**Maggie Pierce** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"owen","desc":"**Owen Hunt** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"nicole","desc":"**Nicole Herman** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"addison","desc":"**Addison Montgomery** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"burke","desc":"**Preston Burke** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"riggs","desc":"**Nathan Riggs** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"erica","desc":"**Erica Hahn** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"warren","desc":"**Ben Warren** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"stephanie","desc":"**Stephanie Edwards**","count":0},{"name":"megan","desc":"**Megan Hunt** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"brooks","desc":"**Heather Brooks** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"murphy","desc":"**Leah Murphy** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"eliza","desc":"**Eliza Minnick** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"ellis","desc":"**Ellis Grey** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"adele","desc":"**Adele Webber** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"betty","desc":"**Betty Nelson** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"shane","desc":"**Shane Ross** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"thatcher","desc":"**Thatcher Grey** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"sambello","desc":"**Sam Bello** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"reed","desc":"**Reed Adamson** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"lucyf","desc":"**Lucy Fields** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"charlesp","desc":"**Charles Percy** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"bokhee","desc":"**Nurse Bokhee** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"mspencer","desc":"**Mitchell Spencer** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"dahlia","desc":"**Dahlia Qadri** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"levi","desc":"**Levi Schmitt** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"kim","desc":"**Nico Kim** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"casey","desc":"**Casey Parker** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"vik","desc":"**Vikram Roy** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"helm","desc":"**Tayrn Helm** (*Grey's Anatomy*)","count":0},{"name":"greys14","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 14*)","count":0},{"name":"greys12","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 12*)","count":0},{"name":"greys10","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 10*)","count":0},{"name":"greys7","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 7*)","count":0},{"name":"greys13","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 13*)","count":0},{"name":"greys15","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 15*)","count":0},{"name":"greys5","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 5*)","count":0},{"name":"greys2","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 2*)","count":0},{"name":"greys1","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 1*)","count":0},{"name":"greys11","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 11*)","count":0},{"name":"greys9","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 9*)","count":0},{"name":"greys8","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 8*)","count":0},{"name":"greys3","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 3*)","count":0},{"name":"greys4","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 4*)","count":0},{"name":"greys6","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 6*)","count":0},{"name":"greys16","desc":"**Grey's Anatomy** (*Season 16*)","count":0},{"name":"bomb","desc":"**\"As We Know It\"** (*Grey's Anatomy, Season 2 Episode 17)*\n\nWith her hand in the chest cavity of a man with a homemade bomb, Meredith Grey stands there waiting for the bomb squad to take over the situation.

This time he has a gun. He ends up shooting many people, many who die. Derek is shot and Christina operates on him. Gary then comes into the same OR and holds a gun to Christina's head and demands she stops fixing Derek because he is the doctor that \"killed\" his wife. Meredith then begs the shooter to shoot her because of her connections to the three doctors that \"killed\" his wife. He hesitated when Cristina told him Meredith was pregnant, which gave Owen the opportunity to try to take the gun from him. Owen was then shot himself. Jackson then told Cristina to stop operating. They watched as the monitor flatlined and Gary left. Shortly after he left, Jackson reconnected the leads he'd secretly disconnected and they continued their work as Meredith and April took Owen to the next OR and worked on him. While April and Meredith prepared Owen to remove the bullet from his shoulder, Meredith had a miscarriage, but continued to work.","count":0},{"name":"fire","desc":"**\"Ring of Fire\"** (*Grey's Anatomy, Season 13 Episode 24*)\n\nAfter an explosion in the hospital caused by Stephanie after she goes to Keith (The rapist patient who threatened to kill her to escape the hospital) and sprays him with alcohol as he lifts the fire up to a sprinkler to set the fire alarms off, ending the lockdown.
